# Cooking Assistant Mobile App

## Introduction
Cooking Assistant Mobile App is a modern Android application developed in **Kotlin** using **Jetpack Compose**. It serves as the frontend for the [Cooking Assistant API](https://github.com/CookingAssistantMobile-org/CookingAssistantAPI), providing users with an intuitive interface for managing recipes and interacting with the community.

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture, ensuring clean code organization and scalability. It supports user registration and authentication via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and integrates seamlessly with the backend API using **Retrofit**.

## How to use
1. Clone this repository and switch to development branch.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure the [CookingAssistant API](https://github.com/filip-wojc/CookingAssistantAPI) is running locally or remotely. For local development, update the base URL in the Retrofit configuration.
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.

---
## Configuration
### 1. Update API Base URL
Edit the `RetrofitClient` configuration:
```kotlin
class RetrofitClient(private val tokenRepository: TokenRepository){
    private val BASE_URL = "http://<your-api-ip>:5080/api/"


    private val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
        level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY
    }
    // Create Bearer Authorization header before sending request
    private val authInterceptor = AuthInterceptor(tokenRepository)

    // configure OkHttpClient for logging, authentication
    private val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
        .addInterceptor(authInterceptor)

        .connectTimeout(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .readTimeout(20, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .build()


    val retrofit by lazy {
        Retrofit.Builder()
            .baseUrl(BASE_URL)
            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create()) // Use custom Gson
            .client(okHttpClient)
            .build().create(ApiRepository::class.java)
    }
}
```
Replace `<your-api-ip>` with your local IPv4 address or remote server address.

## Future Development Plans
1. **Push Notifications**: Notify users about updates, new recipes, and reviews.
2. **Offline Mode**: Enable offline access to saved recipes and reviews.
3. **Multi-language Support**: Add localization for multiple languages.
